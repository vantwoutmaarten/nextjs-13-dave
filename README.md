Redoing all nextjs-13 projects from dave cray

next-02:

- Doing some simple experiments using the routing system in Next.js,
  the linking is very similar to react router.
- Create an about page and a layout file specific to both the home and the about page.
- create links to go back and forth to the about page.
- css styles can be created global, per page, or per layout meaning page and children. So the same file and styles name at multiple levels is possible.
